Objectives
-Define what an algorithm is
-Devise a plan to solve algorithms
-Compare and contrast problem solving
patterns including frequency counters, two
pointer problems and divide the conquer

How do you improve

-Devise or plan for solving the problems
-Master common solving patterns

Problem solving strategies

-Understand the problem
-Explore Concrete Example
-Break it down
-Solve/Simplify
-look back refactor

Understanding the problem
-Can i restate the problem on my own word ?
-What are the inputs that  go into the problem ?
- What are the outputs that should come
from the solution to the problem ?
-How should i label the important pieces of data that are 
a part of the problem ?

Exlporing example
-Start with the simple example
-Progress to more complex Examples
-Explore with empty inputs

Break it down
-Explicity write out the steps you need to take.
